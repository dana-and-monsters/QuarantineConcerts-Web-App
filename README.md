# QuarantineConcerts-Web-App
Quarantine Concerts Interactive Application with Shiny

On January 29th, 2021 I uploaded the current version of the application which includes a functional boxplot and scatterplot. I would like to add a wordcloud and a corelation matrix. These will involve changing the UI to be more dynamic and creating a list of the free text responses for the wordcloud. For the cross-correlation matrix I will need to allow people to select multiple items from a list of numeric variables. I also plan to update the style using css such as changing the buttons to green and changing the background colours.
